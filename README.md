Learning to tidy data
This dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amulyas/penguin-size-dataset?resource=download, and is owned by @amulyas on Kaggle. It has a MIT licence, but is open access and free to be used and published. The data are observations of penguin species and dimesions from different islands. Data were most likely collected by means ofexeprct observations (species), digital calipers (culmen length and depth), a flexible tape measure (flipper length), and a spring scale (body mass). 
The raw data were already tidy in a .csv file, but were wrangled so as to remove columns not of numerical value. This provided ease of analysis. The raw file can be found in the repository as penguins_size.csv.
Packages must be installed and downloaded in order to use the functions.
Lastly, plots were created with the tidy data, so as to provide comparisons between observations.
