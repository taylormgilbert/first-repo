Learning to tidy data
This dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amulyas/penguin-size-dataset?resource=download, and is owned by @amulyas on Kaggle. It has a MIT licence, but is open access and free to be used and published. The data are observations of penguin species and dimesions from different islands.
The raw data were already tidy, but were wrangled so as to remove columns not of numerical value.
Packages must be installed and downloaded in order to use the functions.
Lastly, plots were created with the tidy data.
